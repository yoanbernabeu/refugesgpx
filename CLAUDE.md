# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Astro dev server (http://localhost:4321) |
| `npm run build` | Static build to `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the built site |
| `npm run check` | `astro check` + `tsc --noEmit` — run after changes that touch types or `.astro` files |
| `npm run test` | Vitest, single run |
| `npm run test:watch` | Vitest in watch mode |
| `npm run format` | Prettier on `src/**/*.{ts,tsx,astro,css,md}` |

Run a single test file: `npx vitest run path/to/file.test.ts`. No test files exist yet — Vitest is wired up but the suite is empty.

Node 22 (see `netlify.toml`). Path alias: `@/*` → `src/*`.

## Architecture

**Stack**: Astro 6 SSG + React 19 islands + Tailwind 4 + TypeScript 6. **No backend** — everything runs in the browser; all data comes from public APIs (refuges.info, Overpass/OSM, Camptocamp). Deployed as a static site on Netlify.

### Page model

Only two pages:

- `src/pages/index.astro` — server-rendered `<Landing>` for SEO, plus a `<AppShell client:only="react">` mount. Switching from landing → app is driven by adding `body.is-app` once a GPX is loaded (see `AppShell.tsx`).
- `src/pages/print.astro` — standalone print/topo view mounted as `<PrintView client:only="react">`. The main app hands data over via `localStorage` key `refuges-print-payload`, then opens `/print` in a new tab.
- `src/pages/og.png.ts` — prerendered OG image, built at build time with Satori + Resvg using fonts from `src/assets/fonts/`.

### State

A single Zustand store, `src/store/useAppStore.ts`, owns: parsed GPX trace, buffer step index, enabled type sets (refuges.info vs annex sources), candidate POIs from each source, selection, per-source loading/error flags, and `detailOpenId`.

Important invariant: `setCandidates` / `setAnnexCandidates` automatically prune `selectedIds` to the union of currently-visible POIs (`pruneSelection`). This prevents disabling a source from leaving selection ghosts in the export.

### Data flow per source

`MapView` is the orchestrator. On trace change / buffer change / filter toggle, it:

1. Computes a bbox from the trace (`lib/geo.ts` → `traceBbox` → `expandBboxMeters`).
2. Hits the relevant fetcher in parallel:
   - `lib/refuges-api.ts` — refuges.info `/api/bbox`, `/api/point` (fiche), `/api/commentaires`.
   - `lib/overpass-api.ts` — water points + shops via Overpass QL.
   - `lib/camptocamp-api.ts` — bivouacs.
3. Filters the returned features to the trace buffer with `filterByDistance` (uses `turf.nearestPointOnLine` for true line-distance).
4. Writes `candidates` / `annexCandidates` to the store.

### POI types

`src/lib/types.ts` is the source of truth for type metadata (`TYPE_LABELS`). Each entry carries:
- `valeurAPI` — string used in refuges.info request and in GPX `<type>` tag,
- `color` + `iconKey` + `svgPath` — used both by `<TypeIcon>` (React) and the rasterized MapLibre markers (`lib/markers.ts`).

`REFUGES_TYPE_KEYS` are the five refuges.info categories (on by default minus `pt_passage`). `ANNEX_TYPE_KEYS` (`osm_water`, `c2c_bivouac`, `osm_shop`) are opt-in and stored separately so their loading and errors don't mix with the primary set.

To keep IDs unique across sources (they collide otherwise), OSM ways are offset by `1e10` and Camptocamp IDs by `1e12` inside their respective fetchers — search for `OFFSET` constants if working on selection/export.

### Caching

`src/lib/cache.ts` is a shared IndexedDB key/value layer used by every external API module. Two helpers worth knowing:

- `bboxToGridKey(bbox, step=0.02)` — snaps the bbox to a ~1.5 km grid so that slider tweaks reuse the same cache entry. The API is then queried with the grid bbox (slightly wider than the user's actual bbox), which is necessary for the cache hit to be correct.
- `TTL` — `BBOX: 24h`, `FICHE: 7d`, `COMMENTS: 1h`. Eviction is lazy on read.

Bumping `DB_VERSION` wipes the store on upgrade — do this if entry shapes change.

### Map rendering

`MapView.tsx` uses MapLibre with raw OSM raster tiles (`OSM_STYLE` constant — see README's "Fond de carte" section before swapping providers). POI layers use pre-rendered `icon-image` (from `lib/markers.ts`); no glyph PBF is loaded, so don't add `text-field` to a layer without also wiring up `glyphs`.

### Exports

- GPX: `lib/exports.ts` → `buildEnrichedGpx` — emits the original trkpts unchanged + `<wpt>` per selected POI, with `<copyright>` reflecting which sources were actually used.
- PDF/Topo: triggered from `ExportButtons` → stashes `{ trace, pois }` in localStorage → opens `/print` → `PrintView` re-fetches fiches/comments per POI and renders the printable layout (`PrintMap` for the inset map).

### Conventions

- API responses are validated with **Zod** (`z.looseObject` everywhere) — keep schemas tolerant; the upstream APIs add fields without notice.
- UI primitives in `src/components/ui/` are Radix wrappers (Button, Checkbox, Dialog, ScrollArea, Slider). Use `cn()` from `lib/cn.ts` (clsx + tailwind-merge) for class composition.
- All user-facing strings are in French; keep that convention when adding UI.
- Data licensing is non-negotiable: any new source must be CC BY-SA-compatible and have its attribution surfaced on the map, in the GPX `<copyright>`, and in the PDF (see `exports.ts` `sourcesLabel` logic).
